# NOTE: This will be the calculation of balanced accuracy for your classification task
# The balanced accuracy is defined as the average accuracy for each class. 
# The accuracy for an indiviual class is the ratio between correctly classified example to all examples of that class.
# The code in train.py will instantiate one instance of this class.
# It will call the reset methos at the beginning of each epoch. Use this to reset your
# internal states. The update method will be called multiple times during an epoch, once for each batch of the training.
# You will receive the network predictions, a Tensor of Size (BATCHSIZExCLASSES) containing the logits (output without Softmax).
# You will also receive the groundtruth, an integer (long) Tensor with the respective class index per example.
# For each class, count how many examples were correctly classified and how many total examples exist.
# Then, in the getBACC method, calculate the balanced accuracy by first calculating each individual accuracy
# and then taking the average.
