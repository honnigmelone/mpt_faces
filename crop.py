    #   Iterate over all object folders and for each such folder over all full-frame images 
    #   Read the image (cv.imread) and the respective file with annotations you have saved earlier (e.g. CSV)
    #   Attach the right amount of border to your image (cv.copyMakeBorder)
    #   Crop the face with border added and save it to either the TRAIN_FOLDER or VAL_FOLDER
    #   You can use

    #       random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) < float(args.split) 
    #
    #   to decide how to split them.
